/*(Geometry: intersecting point) Write a method that returns the intersecting point of 
two lines.Â The intersecting point of the two lines can be found by using the formula 
given in Programming Exercise 3.25. Assume that (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) are the 
two points on line 1 and (x3, y3) and (x4, y4) are on line 2. The method header is:
public static double[] getIntersectingPoint(double[][] points)
The intersecting point of the two lines can be found by solving the following linear 
equations:
 (y1 - y2)x - (x1 - x2)y = (y1 - y2)x1 - (x1 - x2)y1
 (y3 - y4)x - (x3 - x4)y = (y3 - y4)x3 - (x3 - x4)y3
The points are stored in a 4-by-2 two-dimensional array points with (points 
[0][0], points[0][1]) for (x1, y1). The method returns the intersecting point 
or null if the two lines are parallel. Write a program that prompts the user to enter 
four points and displays the intersecting point. */
